# RPG Labyrinth Game

A modular RPG dungeon-crawler developed as a final project for the *Object-Oriented Programming* course at **WUT MiNI**.

Built with **C#**, the project focuses on clean architecture and strictly adheres to **SOLID principles**. To ensure scalability and maintainability, the following design patterns were implemented:
* **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Separates game logic from the user interface.
* **Observer:** Handles event-driven game interactions.
* **Decorator:** Manages dynamic item stats and buffs.
* **Singleton:** Controls global game state and display.
* **Chain of Responsibility** Handles user input.
